# EdvoraApp

Application for Edvora. To quote their requirement:
We would like to see your work before we proceed further with the screening process. As our filtering test, we would like you to create an authenticated feed system using FastAPI and Socket.IO. It needs to have login/logout functionality with session management, such as terminating other active sessions of the same user from one session. The feed should have the username and message, and should be broadcasted to all authenticated users connected via websockets. You may create a frontend to showcase the submission, but it is not necessary. Extra points if you can make it keeping scalability and efficiency in mind.
